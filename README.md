# CAIR client for Nao and Pepper
This repository contains the CAIR applications, available for the SoftBank robots Pepper and Nao.

To interact with the CAIR system, open the CAIR_MainApp application folder in Choregraphe, deploy it on the robot and launch it using one of the following trigger sentences:

Let's talk
Talk with me
The chit-chatting behavior of the CAIR_MainApp application can also be launched directly from Choregraphe.

Once started, the application allows interacting with the CAIR Cloud.

To stop the application say:

Stop talking
Quit the application

All the other applications are integrated with the main one and allow the robot to perform extra actions during the conversation. For a better and more complete experience, it is advised to install all the applications on the robot.

For a detailed description on how to install and use the software, please consult the following Handbook: [CAIR_SW_Handbook.pdf](https://github.com/lucregrassi/CAIRclient/files/7039426/CAIR_SW_Handbook.pdf)
